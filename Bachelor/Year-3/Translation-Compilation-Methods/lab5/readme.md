# Lab5

Write a PEG-parser for a grammar of simple arithmetic expressions (with integer consts, operation `+` and `*`), which generates AST-tree. Use the [lingo](https://github.com/area9innovation/flow9/blob/master/doc/lingo.markdown) library. Convert an AST-tree of arithmetic expressions back into a string. Implement a calculator, which computes the value of an arithmetic expression.


# Usage
